# Motivations and Goals
---
# Motivations: Personal

* "Artistic Expression"

 * Most appropriate for my modern skillset

 * Plenty written connecting music, art, code

* Learning

 * Extend existing Clojure zealotry to client-side

 * Complete a project to solidify skills
---
# (Slightly) More Concrete Goals

* Categorize and present tracks
 * by nation (map)

 * by composer (list)
 
 * by years composed, performed (timeline)

* Learn specific technologies
 * ClojureScript

 * Re-Frame/React
---
# Goal: First Sketch
![image](broad-sketch-small.png)
---
class: center, middle
# Process and Major Milestones
---
# Process
* Very loosely defined

* Work towards something resembling sketch, "looking good"

* Ended up being something like "Agile", but with random sprints

* Stepped back a few times to re-evaluate assumptions
---
# Milestone: Data Definition
![image](data.png)
---
# Milestone: Data Acquisition
* Started with ~100 Composer, Track Name pairs

* Place/time data per track very difficult, didn't do

* Wikidata best ToS-free source for composer birth time/place
---
# Milestone: YouTube as Player
* Quality of search immensely helpful

* External streaming service: no bandwidth costs

* Requires displaying video, had to modify UI
---
# YouTube Re-Design

# Final Result
---
# Full Application

---
# Full Application
![image](alternative-view-small.png)
---
# Goals Met

* Enables listening based on place

* Presents a thematic interface 

* Creates a novel dataset

* "I learned a lot"
---
class: center, middle
## Learning Sample: React + Re-Frame

![image](re-frame_flow.png)
---
# Goals Not Met

* Incomplete Functionality

 * Doesn't utilize track date + place

 * Couldn't get a timeline in UI

* Difficult to scale dataset
---
class: center, middle
# Next Steps
---
# Next Steps: Data
* Scaling up

 * Adding tracks currently manual

 * Leaning on user feedback requires users

* Standardization
 * Deciding on target track length

 * Aesthetic track titles
---

## Track Length and Name Examples

---
# Next Steps: Application

* General usability

 * Ability to search for composers, tracks

 * Easier queue manipulation

* Mobile Application
 * Practical listening for normal people

# Lessons Learned and Extrapolated
---
# Lessons: Having Time is Good

* As a general employee

 * Schedule meetings wisely

 * Check email sparingly

* As a manager
 * Protect employees from outside communication
---
# Lessons: Responsibility

* No part of project felt like wasting time

* "Everything" was my responsibility, had to do

* In a team, if something is unpleasant and unassigned, it will not get done
---
# Lessons: Having Time is Bad

"Work expands to fill the time allotted it."

* You need (from self or others)

 * Milestones

 * Deadlines (even "arbitrary")
 * Outside Pressure
